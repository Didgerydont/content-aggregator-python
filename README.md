As a user, I would like to:

  - Know the title of an episode
  - Read a description of the episode
  - Know when an episode was published
  - Have a clickable URL so I can listen to the episode
  - See an image of the podcast so I can scroll to look
    for my favorite podcasts
  - See the podcast name

As a developer, I would like to:

  - Have a uniquely identifiable attribute for each episode
    so I can avoid duplicating episodes in the database
